# OLED-preamp
building a preamp and want to add an OLED display (NewHaven 80x30)
let's start with the name, fritzwilley.  no, my name isn't fritz or willey, although either one would be nice for a cat (maybe a dog).  
I live in the Northwest and I don't do code, programming or any sort along those lines.  I build the occational amplifier (audio)or other bits.
Right now I'd like to build a balanced preamp and would like to add an OLED display to it.  It would display selecct (phono, tuner, tape, CD) and volume.
I was reading a post from DIYaudio and there is something alreadyu created by zdr in Belgium (2005) and shared around.  I believe someone put it here.
